						I believe motherhood is an absolute gift, honor, and blessing, but it can also feel exhausting, uninspring, and suffocating. I help moms move from burnt-out to bubbly and dull to dynamic. When we live passion-filled lives, our children grow up to be leaders.

					<p>It was my lifelong dream to become a mother.  The images I held in my head of motherhood were filled with soft, romanticism--baby giggles, Eskimo kisses, soft tummies, and pastel hues.</p>
					<p>That dream came crashing down hard when I woke up one day with two colicky newborn twins and a two year old:</p>
					<p class='story'>
						"Ugh. Another long day alone with the kids, counting the hours till Husband gets home.<br>
						It's like Groundhog's Day, everyday.<br>
						Dear God, please send me a real adult and real conversation.<br>
						I married the guy and had three kids with him, but will I ever like my husband again?<br>
						How am I so exhausted when NOTHING got done today?<br>
						Yay! Coffee and Wine--My two BEST (and possibly only) friends.""
					</p>
					<p><strong>Those thoughts ran through my head daily and on repeat.</strong></p>
					<p>I was constantly wondering, "How can I be a fully engaged, present, and nurturing mother, without burning out and feeling resentment?</p>
					<p>
						<strong>How can I not just survive motherhood, but really THRIVE in my life and in this role?  Is it even possible?"</strong>
					</p>
					<p>That's when I decided to prioritize MY health and well-being.  Now, I have a wellspring of energy, love, and patience to give to my family:</p>
					<ul class='successes'>
						<li>I no longer depend on coffee to wake me up and get me through my day.</li>
						<li>I don't reach for the wine or a nightcap to ease the tension and help me relax before bed.</li>
						<li>Yelling in our household has decreased drastically.</li>
						<li>My husband is my lover and partner again, instead of a roommate I resent.</li>
						<li>I am never lonely anymore. I've surrounded myself with like-minded women who provide endless support and love.</li>
						<li>I'm present, engaged, and connected with my kids.</li>
						<li>I'm in the driver's seat of my life making my dreams come true, instead of just going through the motions of day-to-day responsibilities.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Not only have I been able to achieve these things for myself, but I've been able to help my clients reach these goals (and more!) as well.</p>
					<p>On my journey toward healing myself, I enrolled at the Institute for Integrative Nutrition and earned my certificate in holistic health coaching.  I've since immersed myself in deepening my transformational coaching skills with Holistic MBA's Transformational Coaching Method, Celebrity life coach Jeannine Yoder's Mentor Masterclass, and the ongoing support of my own mentor.</p>
					<p>My 1:1 program "Surviving to Thriving" will have you waking up with excitement, energy, and and a satisfaction for life that will spill over to your family and loved ones.  Find out more about it here.</p>
